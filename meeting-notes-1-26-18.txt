Meeting 1-26-18

Proposed Methods:

Monitor brain activity while solving math problems vs finding a word
    - maybe not math problems but finding a number in a number scrabble? would that affect the outcome?
    - # of hub neurons for language vs numbers and reaction time

Contrast the results between 2 test groups, one that is monolingual vs bilingual
    - what would the difference be if we gave them words foreign to both test groups (unknown language)
    - possibly using roman numerals instead of numbers?

Next Steps:
- situate IRB proposal/consent form
- make connections with people in the foreign language (possibly talk to exchange students)
- find more related research papers via web/Maag Database and upload to Github as potential sources
- Add Dr. Bayrak to Github Organization
- familiarize team members with Github
- familiarize team members with emotive epoch

Scheduled:
    3:30 PM Wednesday, January 31st 2018
    Agenda - touch/use emotive epoch on member of the group, invite and discuss with Dr. Bayrak
